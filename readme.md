## CakePHP States Plugin ##

The States plugin is a building-block plugin that should be the de-facto standard for state data. Currently the states plugin is United States only If you want to add other countries, I would suggest branching this plugin and adding the additional countries/states to that specific branch.

There is a sql dump in the config/schema folder that contains the state data. Execute this dump after you run the schema file.
